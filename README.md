# Light_Transformer

This repo covers two Transformer Architectures. One is Vanilla_Transformer and the other is Light_Transformer. Vanilla Transformer is simple implementation of famous paper "Attention is all you need" and Light Transformer is Lightened version of Vanilla Transformer. To Lighten Transformer Architecture, Parameter Sharing and Factorizing Techniques has applied.

Ultimate goal of the experiment is to Lighten Model with minimal performance degradation.
Comparisons were made for two Natural Language Generation Tasks(Neural Machine Translation and Single turn Dialogue Generation)
