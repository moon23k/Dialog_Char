## Character Dialogue Generation

People communicate with others through conversation. And one's personality is shown in the process of conversation. Personality makes the conversation much more enjoyable than the conversation without it. However, in the case of a dialog generation model which learns human conversation patterns based on large-scale data, such individuality does not exist. This repo presents a methodology that can give a personality to a model using seqGAN technique and HIMYM conversation dataset.
